# Willa & Elena

#### Let's see our example implemented in R. ####
# Take the sum of numbers 1-10
sum = 0
for (i in 1:10){
  sum = sum + i
}

# Write a for loop for each of the three problems on the powerpoint: 

# Question 1 


# Question 2


# Question 3



# CHALLENGE: you have to turn in several assignments over the semester. 
# your final grade is the mean of your assignment grades. 
# Manually calculate the mean of your grades (don't use mean())



# Can you express this in mathematical notation using sigma?
